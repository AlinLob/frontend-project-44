# Brain-games
____
__`"Brain-games"`__  is a set of five console games built on the principle of popular mobile applications for brain pumping. Each game asks questions that need to be answered correctly. After three correct answers, it is considered that the game is over. Incorrect answers end the game and offer to go through it again.

Presented games:
 + Calculator. Arithmetic expressions that need to be calculated.
 + Progression. Search for missing numbers in a sequence of numbers.
 + Definition of an even number.
 + Finding the Greatest Common Divisor.
 + Definition of a prime number.

____
+ ### Brain-progression 
      The essence of the game is: the user is shown a series of numbers forming an arithmetic progression, one number is hidden in the arithmetic progression and is replaced by two dots. The user must identify and write down what this number is.
  #### Starting the game
